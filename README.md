## Introduction
Welcome to the AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard project! AdventureWorks is a sample database published by Microsoft to demonstrate SQL Server database design. In this project, we have created a Power BI dashboard that provides insights and analytics based on the AdventureWorks database.


## Tools Used:
#### - Power BI was employed for data visualization and analysis due to its capability to handle large datasets and create interactive reports.
#### - Figma: Utilized for designing and prototyping dashboard layouts and user interface elements.



## Dashboard Features
Our Power BI dashboard offers various features and visualizations to help you explore and understand the AdventureWorks database:

- Interactive visualizations such as charts, graphs, and tables.
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for monitoring business metrics.
- Slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.
- Drill-down capabilities to dive deeper into specific data points.
- Custom visuals for enhanced presentation of insights.
- Tooltip feature for providing additional context and details on data points when hovering over visualizations.
